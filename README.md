# PetRec
PetRec is a full stack web applicaiton that recommends adoptable pets that best suit your lifestyle.

Petrec aims to reduce the rate of pets put up for adoption by informing users of the opportunity cost of owning their ideal pet. The primary reason pets are given up is because the owner doesn’t plan ahead for expenses related to taking care of their pet. By showing users the full cost of owning a particular breed of pet, we improve the pet’s chances of finding a home that can adequately take care of them and also give the owner more information to make a financially responsible decision.
